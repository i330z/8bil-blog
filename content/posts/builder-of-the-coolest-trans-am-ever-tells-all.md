description: >-
  It's early and unpleasant, and I am woefully uncaffinated. I brave my way
  through my small apartment towards the kitchen. My back and my left hip ache.
  I am getting older; crankier. The steady march of time is steadily kicking my
  ass, a situation I am most keenly aware of in the early mornings.
